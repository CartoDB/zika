# The Zika virus explained through maps


## Zika symptoms and description

## On the evolution of the epidemy

> Q Dr. Fauci, how did this seem to catch us so by surprise?

> DR. FAUCI: It caught us by surprise not in the sense of what we should of known -- because for essentially, since the virus was first recognized in 1947 and the first human cases were 1952, it was a relatively inconsequential virus in the sense of a rather mild illness, virtually no mortality, no hints or signals of other things that we're seeing now. For example, the microcephaly, the congenital abnormalities, or Guillain-Barré.

> And what happened? And we don’t have all the answers to this -- when it then had its first outbreak, and the first outbreak was in the Yap Islands, that when things started to explode. And we still didn’t get all the information from them. And only when it hit a vulnerable, big population with a lot of mosquitos, with people who have never exposed to this before, did we then start seeing the unfolding of this scenario that every week, every month, it tends to surprise us even more. But the initial part of it, there was really no reason to be very suspicious that this would be bad. It was one of those viruses that just gave a mild illness.Q Dr. Fauci, how did this seem to catch us so by surprise?

## map: the global situation

DATA SOURCE: Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zika_virus_outbreak_(2015%E2%80%93present))

This maps shows the number of cases for each country of the world.
There is an important distinction to make between imported cases (in teal) and locally transmitted cases, most likely by the biting of a carrying mosquito (in orange in the map).
Zika has started to be fatal (red dots in the map) in some places (4 in Brazil, 4 in Suriname).
Squares size is proportional to the amount of suspected cases, in some cases 100 times the number of confirmed cases as in Brazil.

## map: the situation in the US

DATA SOURCE: CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/united-states.html)


> We are quite concerned about Puerto Rico, where the virus is spreading throughout the island. We think there could be hundreds of thousands of cases of Zika virus in Puerto Rico, and perhaps hundreds of affected babies. We know that the pregnant women in Puerto Rico are very keen to protect themselves and to have community protection, and we're working closely with the authorities in Puerto Rico to support that response with mosquito control beginning and with the distribution of what we call Zika prevention kits for pregnant women.

>Q Thank you. Doctor, you mentioned you expected there to be hundreds of thousands of cases in Puerto Rico. Do you have a prediction or a range of how many you expect in the United States broadly?

>DR. SCHUCHAT: You know, much of our predictions come from what we saw with dengue virus and chikungunya virus, and those two viruses are also spread by the same mosquito. In Puerto Rico, they ranged between 25 and 80 percent of the population getting infected with one or the other of those viruses over the course of one or multiple seasons.

> In the continental U.S., those -- we have seen travel-associated cases of chikungunya and dengue. We haven’t seen large numbers, we haven’t seen thousands of cases of locally transmitted disease from the mosquitoes. We’ve seen dozens of cases. But we absolutely need to be ready.

> As Dr. Fauci was saying, everything we look at with this virus seems to be a bit scarier than we initially thought. And so while we absolutely hope we don’t see widespread local transmission in the continental U.S., we need the states to be ready for that. And that was part of what our summit was about -- learning all they could about mosquito control, what do we know, what do we now know, what can we do with the tools that we have today, and how to get ready for mosquito season; when they have a case of travel-associated, how to look around that individual for the mosquitoes nearby.

> (...)

>So I don’t expect there to be large outbreaks in the continental U.S. I can’t give a number to how many cases, but I can say that we can't assume we're not going to have a big problem. We know with other viruses we've had bigger problems than we expected, so we're taking this very seriously.

No locally transmitted case has been recorded in continental US as of now, but with summer coming this is likely to happen, in Florida but also elsewhere (see further maps)
Puerto Rico and Hawaii have been already heavily affected by the virus.

## map: how the epidemy travels

DATA SOURCE: PlaneStats.com

Zika spread like other arboviruses (viruses carried by insects) such as dengue and chikungunya / typical outbreak :
- an infected traveller arrives to an area
- mosquitoes of the Aedes genus picks up the virus bites the traveller
- mosquitoes start biting, outbreak starts

Zika is asymptomatic in 80% of cases thus making prevention even harder.

> We really want the traveling public, when they come back from the Caribbean or Latin America, to use repellant for the couple weeks after they return, because if they silently got Zika infection and they get bit by a mosquito in the continental U.S., that mosquito can then spread the virus.

## map: worldwide areas at risk (how likely is zika to affect your country)

DATA SOURCE: Oxford Research https://elifesciences.org/content/5/e15272

A recent research (April 19th) greatly helped us providing fine grained data on what areas of the world and the US are at risk and further finding out demographics of these areas.

By running a computer simulation, researchers from the University of Oxford were able to determine, for each part of the globe, how likely was Zika to spread.

More precisely, how environmental factors (environmental suitability) will or will not accelerate the spreading of the virus.




>The latest research showed mapping Zika was more complex than simply defining where the mosquito can survive.
One of the researchers, Dr Oliver Brady from the University of Oxford, told the BBC: "These are the first maps to come out that really use the data we have for Zika - earlier maps were based on Zika being like dengue or chikungunya.
"We are the first to add the very precise geographic and environmental conditions data we have on Zika."
By learning where Zika could thrive the researchers could then predict where else may be affected. The researchers confirmed that large areas of South America, the focus of the current outbreak, are susceptible.
In total, 2.2 billion people live in areas defined as being "at risk".

>We have learned that the mosquito vector, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is present in a broader range of states in the continential U.S.. So instead of about 12 states where the mosquito, Aedes aegypti is present, we believe about 30 states have the mosquito present.
